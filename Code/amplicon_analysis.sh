# USAGE ASSUMPTIONS: 
#   - fastq files:
#       - fastq data is in the ampliconData folder in the nguyengroup 
#       - fastq data is set up with run_name/fastq and run_name/QC folders
#       - the run_name is used with this shell script
#           - when this script is called, type "sbatch amplicon_seq_processing_adapted.sh run_name" into the terminal
#       - ONLY fastq files are in the fastq folder
#       - data files are in .fastq.gz format
#   - Operator folder and script structure:
#       - the operator has set up a folder for amplicon analysis, in which this shell script is present
#       - this folder has a folder for "runs" and a folder for "scripts", and these folders are named as such
#       - the "scripts" folder contains the "pair_amplicon_fastqs.py" python script and the "Levenshtein_txt.R" R script
# Outputs
#   - csv files with sequences and reads for pre- and post-Levenshtein aggregation for each sample and each library
#     - Be aware that all 3 library sequences are tested against each sample, so it is critical to know exactly which library any given sample should belong to
